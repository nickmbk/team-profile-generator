  # Team Profile Generator

  ## Description

  This Node application takes in information about a team of developers and generates an HTML file that displays all the information taken about the team, to give the user quick access to the teams email addresses and GitHub accounts.

  I built this app so that the user has information about their development team all in one place, they can then easily find the information about each person in one place.

  I used JavaScript and Node JS, within Node JS I used the modules Jest, for testing, and Inquirer, to take in user inputs.  The file generated by this application uses HTML, CSS and BootStrap.  I used Node so that the application could be run from the command line rather than running JavaScript in the browser.

  I found Inquirer a little difficult when trying to implement validation on user inputs.  I have currently left this out of the project, but will look into this, as I think it will be very valuable to have.  I found the documentation for Inquirer is not very explanitory.  It has examples but doesn't explaint these well.

  I have learnt more about classes and subclasses.  In the beginning I understood classes on a basic level, but subclasses confused me a little.  After working with them a bit more, I now understand how they work a bit better.

  In the future I would like to add the validation that I mentioned earlier.  Maybe an edit feature, so you can edit members of the team if anything changes, such as people leaving, new members, someone's email address changes, instead of having to generate a whole new file.
